7/31/2009 directory added to the repository for eventual link to the implicit
solver option in /src/implicit_mod.F90, which has routines that call the
subroutines in this directory: noxinit, noxsolve, and noxfinalize
(not including the preconditioner)

This directory contains the routines to call the trilinos solver packages. 
The trilinos library needs to be used for these routines to work.

To build Trilinos, the configure script in the file config_trilinos 
was used for the platform indicated. It will not stay in date as Trilinos
is updated, but provides a starting point for successfully building trilinos 
using the packages in HOMME For more info check out: http://trilinos.sandia.gov 

To use the implicit solver for the 2D shallow water version of HOMME, the 
input.xml.2d file and precon.xml files need to be copied into the local directory 
of the model run as input.xml and precon.xml so that the solver parameters can 
be assigned. These templates are provided as a starting point. 

12/17/2010 To use the implicit solver for the 3D version of HOMME, copy over the 
input.xml.3d file to input.xml (along with precon.xml as with the 2D) into 
the run directory you will use. Right now it is set to produce maximum output for 
analysis.

To build and run the fully implicit solver option, first build the code with
the 'make swim' (shallow water) or 'make prim' (3D) commands in the build.Linux 
directory. A working build of trilinos with the packages required by the 
LOCA/NOX solver is needed. This version of the code is kept current with the 
default build of Trilinos on ORNL's Jaguar system.

Then select the integration='full_imp' option in the namelist, and copy over the
.xml files, as instructed above, to the run directory and run the code as desired.
